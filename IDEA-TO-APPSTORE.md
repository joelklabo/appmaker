       var lastCompleted: Date?
       var createdAt: Date
       
       init(name: String = "") {
           self.name = name
           self.streak = 0
           self.lastCompleted = nil
           self.createdAt = Date()
       }
   }
   ```

6. Submit for review

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "No account for team" error
- Add your Apple ID in Xcode â†’ Settings â†’ Accounts

### "Bundle ID already exists"
- Change in `project.yml`:
  ```yaml
  PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: com.yourname.HabitTracker
  ```

### App rejected for "minimum functionality"
- Add more features before submitting
- Ensure app provides real value
- Don't submit basic CRUD apps

## Making It App Store Ready

Transform the basic app into something valuable:

```swift
// Add these features to make it store-worthy:
// 1. Notifications for habit reminders
// 2. Statistics and charts
// 3. Different habit types (daily, weekly)
// 4. Sharing achievements
// 5. Widget for home screen
```

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Create and customize app (30 min)
- **Day 2**: Test with friends via TestFlight
- **Day 3-5**: Polish based on feedback  
- **Day 6**: Submit to App Store
- **Day 7-14**: App Store review
- **Day 14**: Live on App Store! ðŸŽ‰

## Pro Tips

1. **Start simple**: Get v1.0 approved first
2. **Use TestFlight**: Test with 100 users before launch
3. **Plan updates**: Regular updates improve rankings
4. **Monitor reviews**: Respond to user feedback
5. **Market your app**: App Store optimization matters

## What's Next?

After your first app is live:
- Add premium features with in-app purchases
- Implement CloudKit for sync
- Create a widget extension
- Build a watchOS companion app

Remember: The hardest part is starting. AppMaker gets you there in 1 minute.
