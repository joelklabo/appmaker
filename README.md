# 🚀 AppMaker

**Create production-ready iOS apps with just a name.**

```bash
appmaker TwitterKiller
```

That's it. Your app is created, opened in Xcode, and ready to run. No configuration. No complexity. Just magic.

## 🤔 But What If I Want...

**Q: Different architecture?**  
A: The generated code is clean and refactorable. Start simple, evolve as needed.

**Q: Custom configuration?**  
A: Every project uses standard tools (SwiftLint, XcodeGen). Customize after generation.

**Q: Different minimum iOS?**  
A: Edit one line in `project.yml`. We start with iOS 18 for the latest features.

**Q: Backend integration?**  
A: Add your favorite (Firebase, Supabase, AWS) in minutes. The structure supports it.
